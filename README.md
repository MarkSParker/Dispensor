Provides dementia patients with a date/time clock which is easy to read and understand, and provides time-of-day context.

Carers may set scheduled tasks and view compliance logs.

Dispensor is implemented as a single-file, client-side only ReactJS app. This means no server, registration or login is required, and all patient information is stored only in local browser memory.

To run, download the file _Dispensor.html_ to your own system, eg a tablet, and open the file using a web browser.
